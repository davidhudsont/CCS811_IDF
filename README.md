# CCS811 ESP32 IDF Driver Project

This a PIO extension VS Code project that contains driver code for the CCS811 Air Quality Sensor.
The driver is for the ESP32 IDF framework.

There are 2 example tasks:
    * 1. A task that polls the CCS811 Device
    * 2. A interrupt driven task that reads CCS811 Device.


The driver is split up into 2 parts
    * The first is the lower level board support i2c driver
    * The second being the CCS811 driver that uses the bspI2C driver.


This driver was developed using the Spark CCS811 Air Quality Breakout:
